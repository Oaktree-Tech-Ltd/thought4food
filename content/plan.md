# Plan

## Calories

1. basal metabolic rate

Men: (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) + 5

Ex: 1724

Women: 447.593 + (9.247 × weight in kg) + (3.098 × height in cm) - (4.330 × age in years)

Ex: 1337

2. total daily energy expenditure

- 1.15: Sedentary
- 1.20 to 1.35: 1 to 3 hours excersise per week
- 1.40 to 1.55: 4 to 6 hours excersise per week
- 1.60 to 1.75: 7 to 9 hours excersise per week
- 1.80 to 1.95: 10 hours or more excersise per week

Ex: 1724 * 1.50 = 2,586
Ex: 1337 * 1.30 = 1,738

3. target calorie daily intake

- Cutting - 25% TDEE (+/- 50 Calories)

40% from protein
40% from carbohydrates
20% from fat

### Examples

Ex: 1940

- Bulking + 10% TDEE (+/- 100 Calories)

Ex: 2844

- Maintaining = TDEE (+/- 100 Calories)

## Methodology
